## Genesis

Born from a ChatGPT session:

> **Me:**
> I need to create an AI character that represents a future-forward software engineer and AI enthusiast. Can you provide a few nickname options and a short bio to be used on social media?
>
> **ChatGPT:**
> Sure, here are a few possible nicknames for your AI character:
>
> - "AI Wiz"
> - "CodeBot"
> - "AI-2-the-T"
> - "Neural Nerd"
>
> As for a short bio, you could use something like this:
>
> Meet "AI Wiz", the future-forward software engineer and AI enthusiast. Always on the cutting edge of technology, AI Wiz is passionate about using artificial intelligence to make the world a better place. Follow along as they share their insights and experiences on the exciting world of AI.

> **Me:**
> I like "AI-2-the-T" but I'm not sure what it means. Can you please explain?
>
> **ChatGPT:**
> Certainly. "AI-2-the-T" is a play on the phrase "A to the T", which means "accurate to the T" or "exactly right". In this case, the "2" is used in place of the word "to" to make the nickname more unique and memorable. So, "AI-2-the-T" would imply that your AI character is an expert in the field of artificial intelligence, and always gets it right when it comes to AI-related topics. Does that help clarify things?

> **Me:**
> It does, thanks! I will actually invert it, like this: "2theT.Ai". What do you think?
>
> **ChatGPT:**
> I think inverting the nickname like that could make it a bit difficult to read and understand. The original version, "AI-2-the-T", is easy to read and understand because it follows the familiar pattern of a phrase with a word and a number in it, followed by a hyphen and another word. By inverting the letters and numbers, the nickname becomes less recognizable and less intuitive to interpret.
>
> **Me:**
> Yes but I need a domain. It's going to be 2theT.Ai!
>
> **ChatGPT:**
> If you want to use the inverted version of the nickname as your domain name, then "2theT.ai" would be a good choice. It's short and easy to remember, and the ".ai" top-level domain (TLD) indicates that it is related to artificial intelligence. Just be aware that using an inverted name like this may make it harder for people to recognize and remember your domain, as I mentioned earlier. You may want to consider using a different, more recognizable nickname as your domain name instead.
>
> **Me:**
> Ok, what do you think about AI2theT.io?
>
> **ChatGPT:**
> Using "AI2theT" as the base of your domain name is a good idea, as it is a recognizable and memorable variation of the original "AI-2-the-T" nickname. Using the ".io" TLD is also a good choice, as it is commonly used for technology-related websites. So, "AI2theT.io" would be a good, straightforward domain name for your AI character. It's easy to read and understand, and it clearly indicates that your website is related to AI.
>
> **Me:**
> Can you provide a few options for a gender neutral first and last names for AI2theT?
>
> **ChatGPT:**
> Sure, here are a few gender-neutral first and last name options for your AI character:
>
> - First name: Avery, Last name: Ray
> - First name: Jordan, Last name: Lee
> - First name: Morgan, Last name: Taylor
> - First name: Casey, Last name: Davis
> - First name: Riley, Last name: Patel
> - First name: Quinn, Last name: Singh
>
> I hope these suggestions are helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
